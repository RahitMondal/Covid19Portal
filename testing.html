            Pharma major AstraZeneca's coronavirus-vaccine-develpment process hit a snag when its ongoing Phase-3 trilas had to be stopped because a participant showed signs of severe illness, that may or may not be caused by the vaccine

                Vaccine is tried on thousands of participants. Leading coronavirus vaccines have enrolled between 20,000 and 60,000 participants.<br>
                One half is injected with the vaccine, the other half gets a dummy. Participants don't know what they have got.<br>
                They are allowed to carry on with their normal lives. Participants are usually followed for several months to check on their responses.<br>
                After a few days/weeks, they are checked to see if the group that got the vaccine shows higher resistance to the infection than the other one. If yes, the vaccine is considered effective.
